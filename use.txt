Reset cameras :
- unplug
- sudo rmmod uvcvideo
- sudo modprobe uvcvideo
- plug cameras
- wait until light turns off
- guvcview (takes some time)
- check it works : go to video, change webcam, check that both work
- if it doesn't work, do every step again

Run :
- do not plug oculus usb (makes it crash)
- cd Desktop/OculusSDK2
- optirun ./OculusWorldDemo.sh
- esc
- move window to oculus screen (on the right)
- put full screen in oculus
- try not to ctrl-c the app, it tends to crash the driver (use alt-f4)

If there is no video :
- check that guvcview sees the streams
- make clean && make (some black magic happens in the configuration files)
